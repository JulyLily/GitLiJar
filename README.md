 Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file
   
   Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:  
     
     allprojects {  
   	  
	  	repositories {
  
  			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  
  		}  
	  } 
   
   Step 2. Add the dependency
  
  	dependencies {  
	
        	implementation 'com.github.JulyLily:Teacup:Tag'
	  
	  }
